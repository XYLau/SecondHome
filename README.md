SecondHome by HopelesslyLost (Orbital 2014)
===========================================
Overview:
SecondHome is designed to help you find your way around in NUS without getting lost. It aims to help freshmen find their way about school by providing them with a database of essential locations (with directions) which are often used by students. 
We are aiming for Project Vostok.

Our Team’s Ignition pitch:

Ideation: 
As a freshman, I want to be able to find my way about NUS so that I won’t get lost. Thus, our website will contain four major categories of essential locations that students frequently use. Namely, these categories are places to Study, to Sleep, to Shop and to Poop. Upon choosing one of the four categories on our website, the user will be able to obtain the relevant locations pertaining to the respective categories and the directions to that location from the user’s location.

We will be using html & css, as well as Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery to create and format our webpage.
Also, we will be using Google App Engine to host our project.

Milestone #1
Create a prototype using powerpoint as a mockup of how the user interface will look like
Finalise details of the implementation of the basic features
Collate some of the base content that we will be including in our website
Milestone #2
Flesh out the user interface into html & css, jQuery and Bootstrap to format the page
Have the base content included in the webpage, such as the locations, directions and images
Milestone #3
From our other teams’ evaluation of our project, we will consider implementing some of their suggested features and work on the improvements they would like to see in our project
We will also look into implementing a GPS-enabled version of our website, a handicap-friendly version which plots out directions to the locations utilising ramps rather than stairs and also including a section in our website which will contain important emergency information.
